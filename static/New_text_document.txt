He lit the freedom's flame, Gandhi was his name.
No violence and no gun, but got the job well done.
He walked the several miles, to awaken the suppressed smiles
Tolerance and the power, he offered like a shower.
He fought till the finish, and fulfilled the countrymen wish 
He was undying inspiration, being the father of our nation.
Let's preserve what he gave, be wise and the brave.
